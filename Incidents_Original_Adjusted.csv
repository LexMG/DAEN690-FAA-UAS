The aircraft was heading south at altitude 2,700 feet setting up for a landing on runway 19L.  No injuries or damage to aircraft were reported.  The strike occurred about 0025 Zulu and aircraft landed 0029 Zulu without incident.  The pilot reported a bird strike, but upon inspection of the aircraft on the ground, the crew could not locate any normal signs of a bird strike, such as blood, feathers or anything biological.  The crew upon reflection said the strike did not sound like a bird which is usually a soft thud, but it sounded more like a sharp crack like a baseball bat.   Because of the lack of biological evidence and the sharp sound of impact, the crew believes they hit a UAS.  Fairfax County PD is being notified of this incident.  0154:  The Washington Operations Center (WOC) called the FAA DEN position and told them Mesa Airlines (ASH) had a maintenance crew re examine the aircraft and the airline is now changing this incident to Bird Strike.

The Security Officer reported that they had 3 drones operating over the facility for roughly 50 minutes (1905-1950). The drones have since moved on, 2 went east over the water and one went west. Turkey Point Security disclosed they contacted HST and MIA to try to verify if the Facilities were aware of any approved drone operations with negative results. They also called the USCG to see if they could assist with the drones over the water. The drones were 3x3 ft with flashing red and white lights. HQ DEN checked with SOSC and confirmed there were no approved UAS operations in that area. HQ DEN then recommended Turkey Point Security contact Miami Dade 305-5985-6263 and report the drones and request their assistance in locating the operators of the UAS. Turkey Point Security also said they had a FBI number 305-944-9101 and HQ DEN recommended they make that report to them as well. 0120 Turkey Point Security made contact with Miami-Dade PD and they were going to send an officer out to take a report.
