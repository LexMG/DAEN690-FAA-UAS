# DAEN690-FAA-UAS

Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) use has become prevalent across the United States in recent years, and misuse by owners could lead to significant dangers to aircraft, especially when in violation of national airspace. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) receives UAS sightings that may pose a risk to aircraft, particularly during takeoff and landing near airports, that is recorded within a semi-structured database without any geospatial tagging, called SkyWatch. The FAA desires to visualize and classify these incidents spatially, as they currently do not have a meaningful understanding of where and how these UAS are being operated to conduct effective countermeasures where possible. Currently, these records are not collated in a coherent database, making location analysis difficult. As a result, in order to acquire these exact locations of these unmanned aircraft, the FAA required processing of the data collected from SkyWatch. Extraction of UAS locations from this database leveraged natural language processing techniques, including regular expressions and string manipulation, from multiple fields. While several incident reports followed a standard template formatting, a significant portion deviated into multiple other formats, requiring various regular expressions to capture the breadth of inputs. Once the necessary information was extracted, this data was then cross-referenced against differing Origin Reference Points (e.g., airports, runways, navigational aids, designated points) and coupled with a distance and bearing to calculate the UAS location for each sighting. These observations were then exported for spatial visualization, allowing the FAA to identify trends and realize potential operation locations for Unmanned Aircraft Systems. Realizing these potential risks will allow for more efficient mitigation actions, as well as policy and regulatory guidance development to improve the overall safety of the national airspace.
